## About Me

<!-- **Previously a Postdoc at [UCLA](https://www.ucla.edu/) advised by [Prof. Kai-Wei Chang](http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~kwchang/members/) and [Prof. Nanyun Peng](https://vnpeng.net/group/).** -->
**I'm currently a Lecturer (Assistant Professor) at the School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, [the University of Queensland (UQ)](https://www.uq.edu.au/) since Nov. 2024.**

<span style="font-size:1.2em;">🔥</span> <b><span style="color:#e74d3c;">Recruiting Ph.D. students and research interns:</span></b> <b>I'm actively looking for strong and motivated students. Both onsite and remote research opportunities are available for interns. If you are interested in working with me, please feel free to drop me an email with your cv. </b>

I was a Research Scientist in [Meta Inc.](https://about.meta.com/). I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from [Nanyang Technological University](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/), where I was fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Tat Jen Cham](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/astjcham/index.html), [Prof. Jianfei Cai](https://jianfei-cai.github.io/), [Prof. Junsong Yuan](https://cse.buffalo.edu/~jsyuan/) and [Prof. Nadia Magnenat Thalmann](http://www.miralab.ch/index.php/rushmore_teams/n-thalmann/). Prior to this, I obtained my Bachelor degree from [Southeast University](https://www.seu.edu.cn/).

My research interests include **multi-modal understanding** (vision-language models, multi-modal reasoning) and **trustworthy large models** (model alignment, robustness, fairness).
